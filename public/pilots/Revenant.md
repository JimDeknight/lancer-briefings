Koschei grew up on Suranir, an ocean world that has been in civil war for most of its existence as a colony. He wanted to get out and experience more of the galaxy aside from endless war, but ironically, he never really had any skills other than fighting, so he signed up for the first group that would take him. Nova Company, a mercenary group that typically worked outside of union space, had no moral objections to working with pirates, criminals, and their ilk. He worked with them for around 6 years before his squad was killed.

A well-paying mission was offered to his team. MSMC had passed on a time-sensitive contract they were not available to complete and thought that Nova Company might be interested. While on the mission, they were ambushed by a Lancer transmitting a MSMC CID, which wiped the squad out with the exception of Koschei, who was AWOL for several days after the ambush and was blamed when he was found. He was even considered a traitor after Nova Company inspected the location he gave as the ambush site and found nothing.

After leaving Nova Company, Koschei joined up with Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company to figure out why his squad was betrayed and why he was framed for it.
