Odunita Latendresse was recently acquired by S&M shortly after graduating the Royal Military Academy. Records and transcripts indicate she was within the top 90 
perecentile of her year and received high marks in academic-based subjects, and standard marks in marksmenship. Additional comments recognize strengths in artillery, 
often sporting a role of assumed leadership in drills and mock skirmishes. Behavioral record includes one incident of physical confrontation against another student, 
with minimal injuries to both parties resulting.

Standard background checks indicate Odunita to be a direct member of the Latendresse family, daughter of Rear Admiral Marcel Latendresse and grand-daughter of Master 
Sergeant Oscar Latendresse II, both mercenaries-turned-military and cited with multiple medals to name. Odunita's provided reason for joining Smoke & Mirrors Mercenary Corp. 
is "family business".

Odunita has been assigned to the "Hell's Hounds" detachment alongside callsigns Mojave & Siscon as a Private. By choice, she has brought along a sword directly inherited from the Latendresse family arsenal.
