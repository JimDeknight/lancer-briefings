# Mission // #002
## Blink and you miss it

The Gof Blink Gate in the Sierra Madre line has been having interstitial malfunctions. Based on orbital calculations, these malfunctions have been happening any time the gate orbits near Gof-2, an ocean world in the Gof system. Union has already dispatched one of their local teams to investigate, but that team requested additional assistance.

# Goals
- Resolve the Blink Gate Malfunctions in the Gof system.

# Stakes
- The Gof system is farther in the Andrah-Sintara Starway, but the intermittent lack of access to the gate will absolutely affect the ability to travel.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
