# Mission // #004
## Wakey Wakey

Harrison Armory is putting out an APB, first come, first serve. On the planet of Nerycia -- yes, that Nerycia -- we have an old mineral claim. To work this claim we need someone to deal with the locals until we have time to send a Harrison Armory Asset Protection Squad. As it stands now, satellite images show a town on our claim, but no activity has been seen, probably cleared by raiders. We know some of you all don't mind getting your hands dirty, so do whatever is necessary to get this job done.

# Goals
- Clear out the town on the Harrison Armory Mineral Claim.

# Stakes
- Accepting this mission and failing will damage Harrison Armory's opinion of our corps, and will affect the jobs we receive. The faster you complete this mission and the less collatoral damage you cause, the higher likelihood of repeat work and higher pay.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
