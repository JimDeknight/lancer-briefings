## A Good Man's War

At the edge of Blink Space, in the system of Marat, a lone man and his army wage war on civilized worlds. Union does not want to bring down overwhelming force to stop this rebellion, but people are getting hurt. They have been sending requests to LANCER teams on the Andrah-Sintara Starway for help.

# Goals
- Neutralize the Roh-Nin Rebellion's Assault Team, either peacefully or otherwise.
- Protect Union's assets in Marat.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. Not acting may result in Union losing contact with Marat and the Roh-Nin Rebellion gaining influence.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
