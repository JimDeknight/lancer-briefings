# Mission // #001
## Silent Relay

A staggering amount of piracy reports have come out of the Coridai system, then suddenly the system and all beyond it went dark. Union believes that something has either damaged the Coridai Omninet Relay, or otherwise bogarted it's signal.

# Goals
- Investigate why the Coridai Omninet Relay has gone silent.
- Investigate reports of pirate attacks in the system.
  - Stop their attacks.

# Stakes
- The Coridai system is one of the crucial Omninet links on the Andrah-Sintara Starway, failure to secure the relay will vastly slow the spread of information, potentially affecting the jobs you are offered.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
