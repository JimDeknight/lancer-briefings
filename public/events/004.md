# MSMC Transport Carrier // 2.21.5014u
Greetings LANCERS, this is **Harrison Armory Human Resources**. We have a job that we believe your particular skillsets would be useful for.

In the Ner system is the planet of Nerycia -- *yes, the very same Nerycia famous for suffering a catastrophic Total Biome Kill at the hands of Seccom during the rebellion*. **Harrison Armory** has a longstanding mineral claim to this world, and before the breaking, had a mining colony established to extract the precious and very valuable *Twinsteel Ore* from the depths of the world. The rebellion caused our Mining Colony to go offline, and now that the dust has settled on the New Nerycian conflict, we desire our due property back. 

Preliminary satellite scans show that a town has cropped up over our old mining colony, but long-form scans have shown no signs of life. Likely wiped out by raiders, any resistance you encounter will also likely be raiders. 

Do whatever is necessary to reclaim our claim.

# Update ---------------------------------------

We will be retracting this offer! Another team from your mercenary corps has already taken and completed this job! Thank you for for your assistance "`MSMC  HELLSHOUNDS`"!
