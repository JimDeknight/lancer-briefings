Alright Worm Food, I got a job for you. This one comes down the pipeline from Union Peacekeeping. There's Blink Gate in the Gof system that has been experiencing strange intermittent malfunctions. These malfunctions range from warping vessels in at the wrong location to as catastrophic as losing departing vessels in blink space. The Union nerds have done their math and found that when the blink gate orbits nearby the world **Gof-2**, the malfunctions intensify, leading them to believe there's some **paracausal hooha** warping the fabric of space or some shit. We don't get paid enough to understand the bullshit that blink space does, but we do get paid enough to find whatevers breaking it and kill it. 

Because this gate is fucked, this will be a one way jump for you. **Gof-2** is an ocean world, but with the gate being fucked as it is, no one has been able to check on the Far Field outpost there in a few months. Thanks to relativity, by the time we get there, they will have gone around 4 years without any kind of support, more than long enough for a cut off colony to die. If they are dead when you arrive, fix whatever is broke, make use of their facilities, then hail us when the gate is functioning properly.

If there is still a local team that has survived, they'll most likely be able to fill you in on particulars, but pack some extra rations just in case.
